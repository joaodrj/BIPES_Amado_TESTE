You can connect, program, debug and monitor several types of boards using network, USB or Bluetooth. Please check a list of <a href=https://bipes.net.br/wp/boards/>compatible boards here</a>. Compatible boards include STM32, ESP32, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi Pico and even Arduino.  <p><b>BIPES</b> is fully <a href=https://bipes.net.br/wp/development/>open source</a> and based on HTML and JavaScript, so no software install or configuration is needed and you can use it offline! We hope BIPES is useful for you and that you can enjoy using BIPES. If you need help, we now have a <a href=https://github.com/BIPES/BIPES/discussions>discussion forum</a>, where we also post <a href=https://github.com/BIPES/BIPES/discussions/categories/announcements>new features and announcements about BIPES</a>. Feel free to use it! Also, we invite you to use the forum to leave feedbacks and suggestions for BIPES!</p><p>Now you can easily load MicroPython on your ESP32 or ESP8226 to use with BIPES: <a href=https://bipes.net.br/flash/esp-web-tools/>https://bipes.net.br/flash/esp-web-tools/</a></p><p>Checkout BIPES Book at <a href=https://bipes.net.br/wp/book-livro/>https://bipes.net.br/wp/book-livro/</a></p> <p>Thank you from the BIPES Team!</p>"
